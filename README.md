# Introduction

EDA_python is the new batch analysis software from Elements. It is entirely written in Python and open source.
Currently EDA_python supports the following operations: 
* [Open files](#Open files "Goto Open files")
* Export files
* Plot Navigation
* Analysis
* Region of interest

In the next few pages we’ll take a quick look at these functionalities.
One of the objectives with the realization of this software was the possibility to apply the same transformation to an opened file and the possibility to come back to previous states of the analyzed signal.

# Open files

Currently EDA_python supports the reading of two data types:
* *ABF*
* *EDH*
To open one of these two files simply click on “File” → “Open”  or use the shortcut key “ctrl+O”.
